  abstract = {The involvement of electric vehicles (EVs) is increasing over the past few years due to several factors including the increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), depletion of fossil fuels, and promotion of renewable deployment. The growth of charging stations is essential to support the transition of conventional vehicles to electric vehicles. This research paper reviews the current and future trends in EV battery charging methodologies and the roadmap for EV adoption in India. The various conventional and advanced battery charging methods and power topologies are discussed based on their mode of operation and comparative analysis. The various levels of EV charging stations are reviewed based on their charging location, charging time, type of connectors used, architecture portfolio, and comparative performance analysis of different power converters used in EV chargers. Furthermore, advanced charging architectures for electric vehicles are discussed intensely, including fast charging, smart charging, wireless charging, and battery swapping and this paper emphasizes the use of integrated renewable energy (RE) with EV charging architecture and optimized energy management algorithms to mitigate the uncertainties caused by transmission power grids. Finally, this paper concludes with the future roadmap for EV adoption in India and put forth various research roadmaps for power electronics-based solutions related to RE integration, energy storage, and smart grid technologies.},

abstract = {In the mobility sector Electric Vehicles represent one of the main opportunities to ensure strong reduction of local pollution. However, their higher costs compared to gas-fuelled cars are still a barrier for their large diffusions. One possible solutions to increase EVs penetration is their use as storage within households equipped with Renewable Energy Sources enabling a flexible energy management, for instance by the Vehicle-to-Grid and/or Vehicle-to-Home scheme. The aim of this paper is to investigate possible management of the EV battery through an optimization approach capable to minimize the electricity supply costs for an Italian residential end-user with PV, considering battery constraints, such as driving habits. A statistical approach of driver behavior is integrated within the optimization approach to define some possible daily driving patterns. The optimization takes into consideration mobility needs, prices for selling and purchasing electricity and hourly electrical, heating and cooling load profiles of the household. On the basis of these constraints the optimizer identifies when PV overproduction can be either used to charge batteries or to partially cover the load demand of the household. Finally, economic and energy evaluations are performed under Monte Carlo simulations to highlight reliability of potential benefits for the household case study.}

abstract = {In this study, a significant literature review on peak load shaving strategies has been presented. The impact of three major strategies for peak load shaving, namely demand side management (DSM), integration of energy storage system (ESS), and integration of electric vehicle (EV) to the grid has been discussed in detail. Discussion on possible challenges and future research directions for each type of the strategy has also been included in this review. For the energy storage system, different technologies used for peak load shaving purpose, which include their methods of operation and control have been elaborated further. Finally, the sizing of the ESS storage system is discussed. For the demand side management system, various management methods and challenges associated with DSM implementation have been thoroughly explained. A detailed discussion on the electric vehicle strategy has also been included in the review, which considers the integration, control and operation techniques for implementing the peak load shaving.}

abstract = {The conventional grid is increasingly integrating renewable energy sources like solar energy to lower carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases. While energy management systems support grid integration by balancing power supply with demand, they are usually either predictive or real-time and therefore unable to utilise the full array of supply and demand responses, limiting grid integration of renewable energy sources. This limitation is overcome by an integrated energy management system. This review examines various concepts related to the integrated energy management system such as the power system configurations it operates in, and the types of supply and demand side responses. These concepts and approaches are particularly relevant for power systems that rely heavily on solar energy and have constraints on energy supply and costs. Building on from there, a comprehensive overview of current research and progress regarding the development of integrated energy management system frameworks, that have both predictive and real-time energy management capabilities, is provided. The potential benefits of an energy management system that integrates solar power forecasting, demand-side management, and supply-side management are explored. Furthermore, design considerations are proposed for creating solar energy forecasting models. The findings from this review have the potential to inform ongoing studies on the design and implementation of integrated energy management system, and their effect on power systems.}
