  abstract = {The involvement of electric vehicles (EVs) is increasing over the past few years due to several factors including the increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), depletion of fossil fuels, and promotion of renewable deployment. The growth of charging stations is essential to support the transition of conventional vehicles to electric vehicles. This research paper reviews the current and future trends in EV battery charging methodologies and the roadmap for EV adoption in India. The various conventional and advanced battery charging methods and power topologies are discussed based on their mode of operation and comparative analysis. The various levels of EV charging stations are reviewed based on their charging location, charging time, type of connectors used, architecture portfolio, and comparative performance analysis of different power converters used in EV chargers. Furthermore, advanced charging architectures for electric vehicles are discussed intensely, including fast charging, smart charging, wireless charging, and battery swapping and this paper emphasizes the use of integrated renewable energy (RE) with EV charging architecture and optimized energy management algorithms to mitigate the uncertainties caused by transmission power grids. Finally, this paper concludes with the future roadmap for EV adoption in India and put forth various research roadmaps for power electronics-based solutions related to RE integration, energy storage, and smart grid technologies.},

  abstract       = {Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) have the potential of providing frequency regulation due to the adjustment of power charging. Based on the stochastic nature of the daily mileage and the arrival and departure time of Electric Vehicles (EVs), a precise bidirectional charging control strategy of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles by considering the State of Charge (SoC) of the batteries and simultaneous voltage and frequency regulation is presented in this paper. The proposed strategy can control the batteries charge which are connected to the grid, and simultaneously regulate the voltage and frequency of the power grid during the charging time based on the available power when different events occur over a 24-h period. The simulation results prove the validity of the proposed control strategy in coordinating plug-in hybrid electric vehicles aggregations and its significant contribution to the peak reduction, as well as power quality improvement. The case study in this paper consists of detailed models of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), diesel generator and wind farm, a generic aggregation of EVs with various charging profiles, and different loads. The test system is simulated and analyzed in MATLAB/SIMULINK software.},

abstract = {In the mobility sector Electric Vehicles represent one of the main opportunities to ensure strong reduction of local pollution. However, their higher costs compared to gas-fuelled cars are still a barrier for their large diffusions. One possible solutions to increase EVs penetration is their use as storage within households equipped with Renewable Energy Sources enabling a flexible energy management, for instance by the Vehicle-to-Grid and/or Vehicle-to-Home scheme. The aim of this paper is to investigate possible management of the EV battery through an optimization approach capable to minimize the electricity supply costs for an Italian residential end-user with PV, considering battery constraints, such as driving habits. A statistical approach of driver behavior is integrated within the optimization approach to define some possible daily driving patterns. The optimization takes into consideration mobility needs, prices for selling and purchasing electricity and hourly electrical, heating and cooling load profiles of the household. On the basis of these constraints the optimizer identifies when PV overproduction can be either used to charge batteries or to partially cover the load demand of the household. Finally, economic and energy evaluations are performed under Monte Carlo simulations to highlight reliability of potential benefits for the household case study.}
